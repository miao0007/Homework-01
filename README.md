# Homework-01
my first homework which is about code refactoring for web accessibility.

Overview

The aim is to make my clientâ€™s website more accessible for all visitors, and another purpose is that make the HTML code more semantic and clearer, simplified the CSS code and reduce redundancy. 

I enhance the website accessibility from following aspects.

1.Add company name and a brief description in the title tag, and add a favicon to this site.
2.Add or rename some elements or class name into html to make it more      semantic.
3.Using the viewport meta tag for mobile browsers.
4.Have a test to make sure this website is keyboard friendly by using Tab. 
   Make sure links can be accurate to right content.
5.Add alt text to images.
6.Adjust colors to make website have a good color contrast.
